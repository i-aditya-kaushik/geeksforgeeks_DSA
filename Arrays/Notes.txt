Arrays
Types of Arrays:
    Fixed Size: C,C++
    Stack Allocated Arrays:
        int arr[10]
        int arr[] = {10,20,30}
    Heap Allocated:
        int *arr = new int[10]
        In java, the arrays are always stored on a heap
    Dynamic Sized: Python list, Java ArrayList, C++ Vector

    Dynamic Sized arrays can act as fixed size arrays as well, therefore, recommended over fixed size

Operations of Arrays:
