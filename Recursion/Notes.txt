Lecture 1: Intro to Recursion
    For Factorial:
    fact(n):
        if(n==0):
            return(1)
        return(n*fact(n-1))
Lecture 2: Problems Using Recursion
    i/p = 5 
    o/p = 5 4 3 2 1 
    get without loop

    Tail Recursive: when we consider the Recursion after we have already provided all the operations and check before the Recursive function can execute
The Rest Problems are coding ones
